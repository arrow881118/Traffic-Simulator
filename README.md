# TRAFFIC SIMULATOR

安全道路駕駛模擬器

## Introduction

 A traffic system, i.e., vehicles spawn randomly in multiple traffic scenarios,  and a user-behavior detecting system with Unity, which educates users by reporting their mistakes on their behaviors in specific traffic conditions after driving the user's vehicle to the destination, with two control types: Logitech G29/Keyboard.
 
## Traffic System

In order to accomplish the idea, built the fundamental object is the great way to start with, which is a car with radar. So that these cars could detect each other and more important, the path and intersection.
